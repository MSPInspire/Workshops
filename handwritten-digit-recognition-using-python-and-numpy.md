## ABOUT

Hi, my name is Ramansh Sharma. I am a Beta Microsoft Student Partner pursuing the magical field of Machine Learning.

## DESCRIPTION

This project was a side project I did as a part of the deeplearning.ai specialization. I made a handwritten digit recognizer using just python and numpy and achieved to score a 98% accuracy on the training set and a 96% accuracy on the test set.

On February 28th, SRM Ramapuram college in Chennai India, hosted their first ever MSP Open Day which happened to be the biggest one in the entire state of Tamil Nadu. I gave a workshop on this project to about 60 participants and received tremendous positive feedback from the attendees.

## TIPS

Although this section is subjective for different workshops and talks, notice some key points in the YouTube video of the presentation.

* **Maintain a loud voice** - It is imperative you maintain a loud voice especially if you do not have a mike. Audience responds to the stress you give in your words. The more you enunciate important terms and concepts, the stronger their retention will be.
* **Ask questions** - In order to keep the workshop more interactive and fun, engage directly with your audience and ask them questions. Even if the questions are casual and simple, the act of simply talking to them amidst an entire audience puts them on an ease and makes them more comfortable.
